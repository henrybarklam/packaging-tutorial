# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use

to write your content. 

In order to upload this package to the PyPI (Python Package Index), you need to generate distribution
packages for the package - these are archives that are uploaded to the Python Package Index and can be installed by pip

The tar.gz file is a source distribution whereas the .whl file is a built distribution. 
Newer pip versions preferentially install built distributions but will fall back ro source distributions if needed
